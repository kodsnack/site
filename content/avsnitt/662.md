Fredrik talks to [Teresa Wu](https://sessionize.com/teresa-wu/) about devops for frontend and AI.

Why does frontend feel so complex? Does it have to be?

We also discuss the value of open language models, smaller and more specific language models and their benefits.

Is "AI" even a useful label anymore? Teresa thinks we'll split into more specific terms over time.

Recorded during [Øredev 2024](https://archive.oredev.org/2024/#/).
