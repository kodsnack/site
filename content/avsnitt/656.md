Fredrik talks to [Maddy Montaquila](https://github.com/maddymontaquila) about building user interfaces, and how .net has come a much longer way than people may think.

We talk about the various .net-related options for building user interfaces, mixing and matching MAUI stuff, Blazor stuff, and straight up web stuff. We discuss the way to go for Windows desktop apps among all these options.

The perception of .net - a challenge and something being actively worked on.

We also touch on actually useful AI, plus some unexpectedly fond memories of the touch bar.

Recorded during [Øredev 2024](https://archive.oredev.org/2024/#/).
