Fredrik talks to [Barry O'Reilly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barry-o-reilly-b924657/?originalSubdomain=se) about software architecture.

Barry has spent a lot of time and energy connecting software architecture to actual code and development work, and finding good ways of actually training new generations of software architects.

Architecture is a level above programming, it is a different skill, and it needs to be properly taught so that more people can think and make active decisions about it. Oh, and architecture happens at a group level. You can't really do it alone.

Barry's quest led him to complexity science, a PhD to actually prove his ideas hold up, and [two](https://leanpub.com/residuality) [books](https://leanpub.com/architectsparadox). The idea that you have to understand what goes on in the code in order to do good architecture is more controversial than one might think.
