Fredrik talks to Barry O'Reilly about software architecture. Barry has spent a lot of time and energy trying to connect software architecture to actual code and development work, and to find good ways of actually training new generations of software architects.

Architecture is a level above programming, it is a different skill, and it needs to be properly taught so that more people can think and make active decisions about software architecture.

Barry's quest led him to complexity science, a PhD to actually prove his ideas hold up, and multiple books. The idea that you have to understand what goes on in the code in order to do good architecture is more controversial than one might think.

Architecture happens at a group level!
