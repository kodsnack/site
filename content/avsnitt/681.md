Fredrik chats to Dylan Beattie about Rockstar, esoteric programming languages (Perl in latin, anyone?), and what might happen after the AI bubble. 

AI will ruin jokes, they can't do things just right. But some things hiding under the label are actually useful as well. Have we been in any similarly strange bubbles before, and what might be left that's useful after it?

Also evolution, revolution, and strange Scrabble facts.

Recorded during [Øredev 2025](https://archive.oredev.org/2025/#/).
