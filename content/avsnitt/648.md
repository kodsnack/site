Fredrik talks to [Gitte Klitgaard](https://nativewired.com/) about managers, diversity, and communication. We discuss how and why management has almost become a bad word. But we need management, and good management. What do you need out of managers when you have autonomous teams?

Conflict handling - we need small conflicts, and learn to handle them so they don't become big conflicts.

Psychological safety and how to build it within and between your teams.

Building diverse teams, which kinds of managers we need, making good things visible, communicating and building psychological safety, diversity in thinking …

… and of course: a quick note on the evolution of LEGO instructions.

Recorded during [Øredev 2024](https://archive.oredev.org/2024/#/).
