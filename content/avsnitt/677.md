Recorded on-stage at [Øredev](https://oredev.org/) 2025, Fredrik talks to Natalia Chepiga about quantum computing and where you, personally, might see it first. We need classical computers to make quantum computers better.

Many thanks to Øredev for inviting Kodsnack again, they paid for the trip and the editing time of these keynote recordings, but have no say about the content of these or any other episodes.

Thank you [Cloudnet](http://www.cloudnet.se) for sponsoring our [VPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server)!
