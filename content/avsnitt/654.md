TK Put in the new edition cover as chapter art for the book chapter! TK

Fredrik talks to [Matt Topol](https://github.com/zeroshade) about [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) and how the Arrow ecosystem is evolving. What makes the ecosystem grow, and why is it very cool to have Arrow on the GPU?

This episode can be seen as a follow-up to [episode 567](https://kodsnack.se/567/), where Matt first joined to discuss everything Arrow.

Hugging face and Arrow - the machine learning connection.

Recorded during [Øredev 2024](https://archive.oredev.org/2024/#/).
