Fredrik talks to [Matt Topol](https://github.com/zeroshade) about [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) and how the Arrow ecosystem is evolving. Arrow is an open source, columnar in-memory data format designed for efficient data processing and analytics - which means passing data between things without needing to transform it, and ideally even without needing to copy it.

What makes the ecosystem grow, and why is it very cool to have Arrow on the GPU? What is the connection between Arrow, machine learning, and Hugging face? Matt emphasizes the value of open standards, even as they work with or within more closed systems they can help open things up, and help bring about more modular solutions so that developers can focus on doing their core area really well.

This episode can be seen as a follow-up to [episode 567](https://kodsnack.se/567/), where Matt first joined to discuss everything Arrow.

Recorded during [Øredev 2024](https://archive.oredev.org/2024/#/).
