Recorded on-stage at [Øredev](https://oredev.org/) 2025, Fredrik talks to [Tiera Fletcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiera_Guinn_Fletcher) about her [lightning tour of going to Mars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=942w3mG8ww0) and what might happen on the way. And also about - for example - finding visions to guide your daily work.

In 60 years, life on Mars could start to be comfortable.

Many thanks to Øredev for inviting Kodsnack again, they paid for the trip and the editing time of these keynote recordings, but have no say about the content of these or any other episodes.
