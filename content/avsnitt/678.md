Recorded on-stage at [Øredev](https://oredev.org/) 2025, Fredrik talks to [Justyna Zander](https://sites.google.com/site/justynazander/introduction) about AI for self-driving cars, the noise of the present, and more.

Don't let the noise of today demolish the positive signal of the future!

Many thanks to Øredev for inviting Kodsnack again, they paid for the trip and the editing time of these keynote recordings, but have no say about the content of these or any other episodes.

Thank you [Cloudnet](http://www.cloudnet.se) for sponsoring our [VPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server)!
