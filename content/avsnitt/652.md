Fredrik talks to [Grace Jansen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-jansen/?originalSubdomain=uk) about cloud tools, and bringing them to your local machine in a better way. Opentelemetry is a great tool, but it's not the whole story for observability. Gathering the data is just the first step.

In the second half, we leave telemetry and talk about realizing you have things to share and sharing them with other people. Find out what makes you tick, and share experiences around that. Grace also shares some concrete presentation-building tips at the end.

Ask the question, and be more you!

Recorded during [Øredev 2024](https://archive.oredev.org/2024/#/).
