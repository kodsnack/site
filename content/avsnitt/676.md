Recorded on-stage at [Øredev](https://oredev.org/) 2025, Fredrik talks to [Simon Wardley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Wardley) about maps (*not* the same as charts!), stories, commodotization, digital sovereignty, getting labeled a heretic by all sides, and a lot more.

Among other things, Simon discusses how you can map things out and thereby find new ways to present and challenge the current state within and organization.

Not that it will necessarily be very popular, hence the bit about being called a heretic.

Many thanks to Øredev for inviting Kodsnack again, they paid for the trip and the editing time of these keynote recordings, but have no say about the content of these or any other episodes.
