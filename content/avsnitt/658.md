Fredrik talks to [Taylor Troesh](https://taylor.town/) about packaging things, generating code, and database evolution.

Why is it so hard to package and build things? Is it a failure of ergonomics? Is there hope for a change?

We also discuss generating code using LLMs, and Taylor presents the workflow of using them to generate projects from scratch, starting over if more fundamental changes are needed.

After that, we dig into databases and SQL, and Taylor has many thoughts and opinions about how they can be used and might evolve.

Finally, we discuss other interesting projects, keeping track of ideas, what the OPTC is, and why should you cut down a palm tree?
