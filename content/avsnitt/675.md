Recorded on-stage at [Øredev](https://oredev.org/) 2025, Fredrik talks to Sweden's foremost trend spotter [Nicklas Hermansson](https://nomofomo.se/) about how you become a futurist. From how Nicklas got there, what his days look like, and how he choses what to read and what to filter out.

Many thanks to Øredev for inviting Kodsnack again, they paid for the trip and the editing time of these keynote recordings, but have no say about the content of these or any other episodes.
